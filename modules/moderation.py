If it can hurt someone else, or make someone feel uncomfortable, don't say it. Everyone has rights to have different opinions, but any hate speech with intentions to do bad will not, and never will be tolerated. This also includes actions such as mini-modding, spreading copypasta, and flooding channels.\n**<:smash_donkey_kong:665610202187431939> 2. Advertising is available, with permission that is.**\nBefore you advertise, please inform a staff member. Don't post the link yourself, it is considered to be rude. Same with advertising your server randomly in someone else's private messages. Note that this will not help you become an affiliate.\n**<:smash_link:665610203634335799> 3. Refrain from inappropriate topics.**\nDo not send, upload content, or set profile information that is inappropriate or NSFW. This includes but not limited to, sex or sexual themes, nudity, extreme violence, illegal content, and the like. Swearing is okay, slurs are not.\n**<:smash_samus:665610206369153064> 4. Mark spoilers as needed, and no piracy!**\nAll spoilers for unreleased and leaked content must be formatted as spoilers until permission has been given to post the information without proper formatting. To do this, put two |s, then your spoilers, then another two |s. Discussion of leaked content obtained through illegal means (pirated content, etc.) will not be allowed in any circumstance.")
